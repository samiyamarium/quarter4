dramatic:
Behind the mask, a world unfolds,
A story told in silent holds.
Each gesture sharp, each glance a spark,
A life reborn within the dark.
The spotlight burns—a fleeting grace,
As truth and fiction interlace.

lyrical:
Beneath the glow of amber light,
I breathe the words that dance in flight.
Each phrase a song, a whispered dream,
A river flowing, soft and stream.
The stage, a sea where moments gleam—
I’m more than flesh, I am the theme.

narrative:
In a village veiled by mist and pine,
Lived an old man who kept the time.
With whispered tales and riddles spun,
He spoke of stars and setting sun.
One night a child dared to ask,
“What secrets lie beyond your mask?”

The old man smiled, his eyes alight,
“Beyond the woods, past darkest night,
A river flows with magic deep,
Where dreams awake and shadows sleep.
But only those with hearts so true
Can find the path and journey through.
